##Faster Than Mongodb Project

Hello there. I hope you're having a nice day. This is perhaps one of the worst Database you would have every seen in your life. The point of this project is not to make a powerful database but to learn how to package a software like this. It took a really long time to get everything thing right. Have fun. Enjoy! The project is called faster than mongodb as an insider joke between my brother and I. He said that I can't design a system that is faster than mongodb. 

##Build & Install instructions
Windows build

`mkdir build`

`cmake ..`

`cmake --build . --config Release`

`cpack -c Release`


This is not tested on any other system. In addition, I've no idea how to package software on other systems such as Linux and Mac.
